title: Initial Outline
version: 0.0.1
---

So far, this is a combination of initial thoughts, outlines, and rough notes for about half of what I'm planning to cover. I realized along the way that I have a more developed sense of checking for understanding in class than I originally thought. I feel like this is gonna be an interesting ride.

In this version, you'll find an outline + notes for the following chapters:

- How to plan a module/unit
- How to plan a successful lesson
- How to leave at 6 every day with peace of mind
- How to tell whether they learned what they’re supposed to
- How to not get bored
- How to figure out what they really need to learn
- How to prepare before class starts
