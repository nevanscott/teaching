## 🤔 What's going on here?

I'm working on a book? course? not sure about teaching in bootcamps, especially geared toward first-time teachers coming from the professional world, and the people who manage them. It's pretty rough early stages, but in the spirit of [📖 Shitty First Drafts](https://books.google.es/books?id=dwfGvtzvte4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA21&redir_esc=y), I'm gonna try to share some of the process as I work on this. Maybe someone out there in the universe will find this interesting. 🤞

## 🖊 Work in progress

For now, you can follow along on the [📦 Releases](https://github.com/nevanscott/teaching/releases) page for the project. For now I'll be publishing release notes and new versions there. If anyone has any idea how to get the content from there to show up on this website, let me know!
