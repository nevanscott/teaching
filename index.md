## Teacher Training

I'm working on a book? course? not sure about teaching in bootcamps, espeically geared toward first-time teachers coming from the professional world, and the people who manage them. It's pretty rough early stages, but in the spirit of [Shitty First Drafts](https://books.google.es/books?id=dwfGvtzvte4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA21&redir_esc=y), I'm gonna try to share some of the process as I work on this. Maybe someone out there in the universe will find this interesting. ðŸ¤ž
